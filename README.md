# first-game
This is my first small project, I completed it when I just started learning programming.
## Some rules

* Basic win/lose/draw rules
* If someone decides to stop the game, then a point is awarded to the opponent, but no side switching occurs
* If zero wins the game, then in the next game the player who played zero already plays crosses
* After the end of the number of games you need, the winner is displayed on the screen
